Plastic pollution kills up to 1 million people each year. This project looks at plastic production and pollution. I used data pulled from [here](https://ourworldindata.org/) (https://ourworldindata.org/), by Hannah Ritchie, Veronika Samborska and Max Roser. The relevant data frames were joined to analyze information about plastic around the world. Global production has been increasing at a rapid pace, and is predicted to continue doing so.
