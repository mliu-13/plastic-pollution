I used data pulled from here (https://ourworldindata.org/), by Hannah Ritchie, Veronika Samborska and Max Roser. The relevant data frames were joined to analyze information about plastic around the world. Global production has been increasing at a rapid pace, and is predicted to continue doing so."
